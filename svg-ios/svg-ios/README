2. Dependencies:

libsvg (version 0.1.4) by Carl D. Worth <cworth@isi.edu> Copyright © 2002 USC/Information Sciences Institute.
    URL: http://cairographics.org/snapshots/
libjpeg (version 6b) Copyright (C) 1994-1997, Thomas G. Lane from The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software.
    URL: http://libjpeg.sourceforge.net/
         http://www.ijg.org/
libpng (version 1.5.10) Copyright (c) 2004, 2006-2011 Glenn Randers-Pehrson.
    URL: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

libjpeg and libpng are required by libsvg. We can remove them by patch libsvg:
- Remove svg_image.c
- Remove all "_svg_image_*" functions in svgint.h & svg_element.c
but this will disable SVG raster images.

3. Change log:

For compatible with ObjC and other libraries, I have to:
- Change function "png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8" in svg_image.c to "png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8" and all related.
- Change libpng & libjpeg reference in svg_image.c from <> to ""
- Remove the below line:
    #include "config.h"
    #include "svg_version.h"
    LIBSVG_EXPAT and related.
in svgint.h.
- To support gradient stop point percent unit: add function "_svg_attribute_get_offset" in svg_attributes.c,
    change from "_svg_attribute_get_offset" to above function in function "_svg_parser_parse_gradient_stop" in svg_parser.c.
- Remove all function "main()" in libjpeg & libpng.

4. Ability:

libsvg-cairo & libsvg are very old so the libsvg-ios's ability is limited. It can not render SVG images which have:
- CSS styling
- Pattern drawing
- Animation
- Advanced style
- Text (can draw text but very basic, almost bad).
... and many other issues.

5. How to build:

With XCode 4:
- Select scheme svg-ios-sim > Iphone simulator, then Build to build libsvg-ios-sim.a for Simulator.
- Select scheme svg-ios-dev > IOS device, then Build to build libsvg-ios-dev.a for device.
- Buil all 2 above lib files, then select scheme svg-ios-universal > IOS device,
    then Build to build libsvg-ios.a which is the combine of both lib for Simulator and device.
    
6. How to import into project:

- Import framework: libz.dylib (for libpng), libxml2.dylib (for libsvg; don't forget add /usr/include/libxml2 to Header search path of Project configuration).
- Import directly source code into project or build into binary then import lib file + header files (in product path) into project.
